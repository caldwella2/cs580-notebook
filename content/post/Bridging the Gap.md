A summary of the knowledge gap that emerges from my chosen research area.

## Current Knowledge Gap

Currently, my knowledge gap is kind of wide although it is slowly decreasing with each article and experiment I find. The biggest gap currently is discovering what kind of SQL injections there are and what kinds I can implement inside of my research.
There are three fundamental current categories of SQL injection: In-band SQLi, Inferential SQLi, and Out-of-Band SQLi and I need to do more in-depth research on each to determine which one I'd like to employ.

I also have to become more familiar with how WordPress works. WordPress is just a MySQL database website. I do currently have one set up, however, there are a few more adjustments I need to make to the website to make it up and running. By watching tutorials and asking questions, it led to working with MariaDB as my base database. When I finally have the website up and running, I will then be able to use my URL inside of SQLMap and view the vulnerabilities in the website.

When I am able to fill these current gaps, I will then be able to perform experiments on my database to see what kinds of SQL injections affect it. I want to see if there are any vulnerabilities in the website prior to me injecting it with different information and ways I can prevent SQL injection.
