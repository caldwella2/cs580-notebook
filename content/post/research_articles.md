### Survey Article from the literature

- Citation of the article

Alwan, Zainab S., and Manal F. Younis. "Detection and prevention of SQL injection attack: A survey." International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing 6.8 (2017): 5-17.

- In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

The goal of this article is to discuss the various types of SQL injection attacks. In addition to discussing the types of injection types, the article also highlights a few tools and techniques to prevent these attacks.

- What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

The general task of this entire survey would be to see if these techniques can prevent, detect, or prevent and detect classic and modern types of SQL injection attacks.

- What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

There are no distinct leading methods in this paper. They are all discussed pretty evenly. While discussing the techniques, they hit the main points of how they function and while discussing the different kinds of sql injection attacks, they get to the main point without going into too much detail about each individual method.

- What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

The context of the methods discussed in the paper is testing out various methods to prevent, detect, or prevent and detect the vulnerabilities in a database. The reason to highlight different ways to detect and prevent is to keep databases and information safe from outsiders. For example, a technique called AMNESIA passed all of the types of the attacks other than two. The same could be said about the majority of the various techniques that were named.

- How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?

In this survey, they take different techniques to detect modern types of SQLIA and in their techniques they used SQLMap which is a technique I am researching about. In their survey, it concluded that SQLMap was used only for detection (not prevention) of SQLI+XSS, SQLI+DDos, and SQLI+Insufficient Authentication. On the other hand it was proved not a useful tool (in terms of prevention and detection) in the areas of Fast Flux SQLI and SQLIA using Cross Domain Policies. This survey has opened up other potential useful tools and methods for my research in SQL Injection attacks in case my journey with SQLMap does not pull through.

### First article from the literature

- Citation of the article

Lawal, M. A., Abu Bakar Md Sultan, and Ayanloye O. Shakiru. "Systematic literature review on SQL injection attack." International Journal of Soft Computing 11.1 (2016): 26-35.

- What is the goal of this article?

The goal of this article is to discuss the reasons behind why people would want to use SQL injection attacks and discuss some methods of attacks.

- In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

With a set of research questions, the authors of this articles base their experiment off of those questions. They list many and various reasons for why people would want to commit sql injection attacks and what kind of attacks they could possibly perform. Now with that set of information, they utilize different procedures to see if the specific software can detect, prevent, or both from an injection attack.
(This article utilized different procedures from the survey above.)

### Second article from the literature

- Citation of the article

Kareem, Fairoz Q., et al. "SQL injection attacks prevention system technology." Asian Journal of Research in Computer Science 13 (2021): 32.

- What is the goal of this article?

The goal of the article is to go in depth about how sql injection works and the process of it.

- In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

The main goal is to describe fully what SQL is and how it works. It discusses the process of how injection attacks works as well as a technique called LDAP used for detecting vulnerabilities in a database. The article also highlights how big of an impact the language PHP is when it comes to talking about the vulnerabilities in a database.
