How do-able is my project?

<!--more-->

## Overall

Personally, I do think my project is do-able. Resource-wise I need access to python, SQLMap, OpenStack, and a working database. With these things, I will create my own data to fill up my database. Pertaining to my experiments, I want to explore what commands produces what results and how the results affect my database. I do think with the amount of data I plan to use it will take me a few months to cover all that I would like to cover. There will be different variations of the commands so I plan to cover all that I can and with that as well, certain conditions have to be met for certain commands to run. All in all I do think this project is do-able.

## Detailed

1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

Other than the obvious machine that I need to work on, I need access to OpenStack. OpenStack is an open source cloud operating system managing compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center using APIs. Being that injection is illegal, having my own "computer" will allow me to create, build, and destroy as I need.

2. Tools: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

First, you need Python access. In order to run sqlmap, the user needs the updated version of Python. I need to know how to use Python because to run the application itself it uses a python file. So, in order to use the file I need to have Python on my machine.
Second, I need SQLMap. SQLMap is an open source tool used to detect and exploit SQL injection flaws. This is the tool I will be using to do SQL injection to see what flaws I can extract from the database I create.
Third, I need access to OpenStack. This resource will allow me to perform my experiments as much as I want without the worry of messing something up.
Last, I need a working database. For this step, I need a working website and database. This is what the resource WordPress will do for me. It will allow me to create a database with users that I will be able to access with my injections.

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

I am slowly becoming familiar with the commands in sqlmap. I feel as though that skill pertains to determination and the want to learn about this topic. There really isn't a specific language that I need to learn other than just the commands of sqlmap which is not really considered a language.

4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

I need to create my data that I will be using for this project. So in my wordpress website, I will have a table for users. Inside this table will contain the users username, password, and email. I plan to generate this data by hand since I do not know how to automate the information. I will create fake users and have the usernames, passwords, etc inside of a separate spreadsheet to keep up with my user's correct information.

5. Time: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

With my best guess, I will need a few months for this project will work. I want to run plenty of experiments and see what kinds of injection attacks/commands affect WordPress. I need to make sure that I have a table full of commands and have a section for the results of how it is produced. Some commands may take longer to produce results while some may take a few seconds. Now, that I'm thinking about it if I wanted to I could create another section filled with how long that command took to produce a result and it will have a '*' beside it if the user needed to input the command.

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

As of right now, I do not know what successful results will look like. However, I would assume that it will look like a table of information with certain commands and their output. Like I stated earlier if I have the chance to create another database I will also compare and contrast the results that I receive.

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

I will analyze my result in a table. Certain commands inside of SQLMap will produce different results. I want to cover what commands produce what results and hopefully in the long run create a different database filled with different information and see if those same commands affect the site in the same way. There also need to be certain conditions met within the site itself for any of the commands work, so I would also like to keep of that as well.

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

I may need to use other types of injections attacks and how those affect databases. There are plenty of injections attacks so if time allows I will implement other kinds of attacks and compare and contrast that information.

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

I feel as though the data I am using can be created again. All I'm using is fake information and that can be replicated with random information. So I do not think there is a threat to the validity as of right now, although this could change as the project continues on.
