This is my about research.

I want to explore and navigate the vulnerability of databases. I am basing this research off a branch of cyber security and I will be specifically looking at SQL Injection attacks.

SQL Injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. It is the placement of malicious code in SQL, via web page input. In researching about SQL Injection, a software that stuck out to me was SQLMap. SQLMap is and open source SQL injection tool and one of the more popular tools to exploit the vulnerability of an application. It automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.
